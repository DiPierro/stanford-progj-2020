# Getting Programming Help

On your quest to become a ninja programmer, there will be many hurdles. As your programming senseis, we are still walking down this path and want to share a few things we have learned along the way.

## It Will Break
As you may have already learned from getting your virtual environments set up and surviving the python installation process, things will go wrong. Enter your code space expecting the bugs to show up before any usable solution and you will save yourself hours of frustration when your code does not work the first, second, or third time around. 


## Ask GOOD Questions:
G: Give context to your issue - clearly describe the problem.
O: Outline the steps you've taken to solve it.
O: Offer your best guess about what the bug is. This will help you think through it and the person assisting you.
D: Demo what is happening. Keep track of the error messages you've gotten, plus the code implemented to create the error, as well as any steps you may have taken to fix it.

## Resources

Serdar and I are both on slack - reach out to us. But, you may not get a response right away. Keep working on fixing your issue. In many cases, you may find that you've already worked it out by speaking through it with a friend or by karate chopping your keyboard. 

But, if you still need help, you can try these resources:


### Semi-Live

* **r/learnpython** this [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/) can be great for crowd-sourcing solutions to your coding issues. Some programmers prefer to use StackOverflow, but I find that the python subreddits are a bit friendlier for new coders. StackOverflow can have coding solutions that are difficult to understand for new programmers, and thus can leave you confused about how to adjust the code to fit your unique problem.

* **Python Tutor** this [website](http://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit) can be a great place to find live help if you are stuck on a particular bug. Beware: Like you, there will be several other new coders that need help. Thus, this website tends to have long wait periods - not ideal for being on deadline. 

* **Python Discord Chat** this [Discord Chat](https://discordapp.com/invite/python) can be awesome for getting help from new and experienced programmers alike. People will definitely want to help, but they are hesitant to do so if it seems like you have not taken any steps to fix the bugs yourself. Do your due diligence before asking for help on this chat or any of the other resources.

### YouTube

* **SentDex** this [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/sentdex) has a good python beginner series where basic concepts are explained. More importantly, he has several projects that you can follow along - showing you what is possible once you get the fundamentals down.


## A Note:

The resources listed above can be helpful, but they can hinder your learning if you jump to them before struggling with the problem yourself. At the end of the day, nothing will help you learn faster than fighting with bugs and thinking through how you would fix them first.
