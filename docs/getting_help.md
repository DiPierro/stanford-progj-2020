# Getting Programming Help

On your quest to become a ninja programmer, there will be many hurdles. As your programming senseis, we are still walking down this path and want to share a few things we have learned along the way.

## It Will Break
As you may have already learned from getting your virtual environments set up and surviving the python installation process, things will go wrong. Enter your code space expecting the bugs to show up before any usable solution and you will save yourself hours of frustration when your code does not work the first, second, or third time around. 


## Ask GOOD Questions:
G: Give context to your issue - clearly describe the problem.
O: Outline the steps you've taken to solve it.
O: Offer your best guess about what the bug is. This will help you think through it and the person assisting you.
D: Demo what is happening. Keep track of the error messages you've gotten, plus the code implemented to create the error, as well as any steps you may have taken to fix it.

## Resources

Serdar and I are both on slack - reach out to us. But, you may not get a response right away. Keep working on fixing your issue. In many cases, you may find that you've already worked it out by speaking through it with a friend or by karate chopping your keyboard.
