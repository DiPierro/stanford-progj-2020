  * Expressions and statements
  * Variables as storage containers
  * Flow control ("for" loops and if/elif/else)
  * Built-in functions such as `len` and `print`
  * Importing and using libraries (Python Standard Library and 3rd-party packages)
* Python features for readable, reusable code
  * Functions
  * Modules
  * Packages
* Practical skills for getting things done
  * [Counting and filtering](count_filter.md)
