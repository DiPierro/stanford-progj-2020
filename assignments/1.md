# Assignment 1

## Python reading and reps

Read and work through the following chapters in [Automate the Boring Stuff][]. **NOTE: You don't have to do the exercises, but you should type in the commands for code examples throughout the text.**

* [Chapter 0 - Introduction](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter0/)
* [Chapter 1 - Python Basics](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter1/)
* [Chapter 2 - Flow Control](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter2/)

## Failed CA Banks shell script

Create an *automated* shell script that performs the following tasks using the [FDICâ€™s failed banks list](https://www.fdic.gov/bank/individual/failed/banklist.html):

* Generate a new CSV called `failed_banks_ca.csv` that contains only failed banks in California. This file must contain the same header row as the source data.
* Print a count of failed banks in California to the shell. You must print the following text: `There are X failed banks in CA`, replacing the `X`  with the correct count. For example: `There are 1824 failed banks in CA`. *HINT: You can use a technique called [command substitution][] to calculate the value and store it in a variable for use in downstream commands (see [csvkit_wrangle.sh][] for an example of using variables in text).* 

[csvkit_wrangle.sh]: https://github.com/stanfordjournalism/stanford-progj-2020/blob/master/code/csvkit_wrangle.sh
[command substitution]: https://bash.cyberciti.biz/guide/

The shell commands used to produce the CSV and count of banks must be stored in a single shell script called `failed_banks_ca.sh`. 

Your are free to use standard shell commands and/or csvkit utilities on this assignment.

To submit the assignment, you must create a new code project using DataKit and save the script in the project's `scripts/` directory.

Here's how to create the new project folder:

```
datakit project create
# When prompted:
#  - Choose "1 - Assignment" as the "repo_type" 
#  - Type "1" for the "project_number_or_shortname".
```

For more details on how to work with DataKit, see [here](automating_workflows.md#automating-workflow-with-datakit).

**NOTE:** Grading for this assignment will be based both on the script itself as well as your attention to detail. For example, points will be deducted if the script is not named correctly and placed in the proper folder of the project.
