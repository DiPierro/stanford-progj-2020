> **Due: Monday. Jan 13th**

* Complete the [technical setup](../docs/tech_setup.md) through the section on configuring Git. Hold off on installing ssh keys or Python for now. If you hit snags, reach out on Slack for help.
* Review the [CLI cheatsheet][] and spend some time practicing navigation and file/directory creation and removal.
* Skim [The Unix Shell][] tutorial. **You do NOT have to do the exercises.** It's a long read. Just skim the contents to get familiar with the Unix shell environment. It's fine to skip the *Loops* section.
